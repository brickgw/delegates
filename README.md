# delegates
The purpose of this project is to play around with delegates and events using the premise of an over simplified AK protocol 
command/response model.

#AK Protocol
The AK protocol is typically used to control some type of hardware device though RS-232 or ethernet connection. The device hardware will respond to commands and 
send a response back to the client. Devices supporting AK have a set of AK commands and arguments that the client can use to control and operate 
the device. The commands in this project are just for the sake of simulation.
